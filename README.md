# TicTacToe Game

### Description:
A simple tic tac toe game created with MVC principles in mind using java, javafx for the GUI and maven. This application allows for two players to play tictactoe against each other, with the goal being the first player to get three symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the 3 x 3 square board. Java, and javaFX were used to build this application to allow for practice developing both in java and making use of the javaFX GUI package. These technologies were of interest to me due to their use in imbedded systems.
